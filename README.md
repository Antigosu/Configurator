Hello!

First of all, this app made for automate my current work as technical engineer. It's my very first attempt to do a full-worked program with some usability. All UI and other names using russian language, but i will add an english version someday, now noone asked me for.

Few quick facts (More information you can get on links or ask me directly):

1. Energy metering and remote control systems based on energy meters BFM-II by Satec Ltd.:
